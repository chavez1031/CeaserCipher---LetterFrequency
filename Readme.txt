CeaserCipher.py and Frequency.py were programed using python v3. 
Run the programs in terminal with python3 or use a python3 compiler.
They are individual programs that ask for user input. 

CeaserCipher.py: Encrypts or Decrypts a string. 
-For encryption enter 1, e, -e, or encrypt. Then enter a non negative number for the key followed by the text to encrypt. 
-For decryption enter 2, d, -d, or decrypt. Then enter the cipher text to decrypt. 

Frequency.py counts the frequency of the letter in a string.
